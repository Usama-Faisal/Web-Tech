        HMS Princess Royal was the second of two Lion-class battlecruisers built for the Royal Navy before the First
        World War. Designed in response to the Moltke-class battlecruisers of the Imperial German Navy, the ships
        significantly improved on the speed, armament, and armour of the preceding Indefatigable class. The ship was
        named for The Princess Royal, a title occasionally granted to the Monarch's eldest daughter.[1]Completed in
        1913, Princess Royal participated in the Battle of Heligoland Bight a month after the start of
        World War I in August 1914. She was then sent to the Caribbean Sea to prevent the German East Asia Squadron from
        using the Panama Canal.
